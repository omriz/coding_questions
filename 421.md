# Question:
Given an array of a million integers between zero and a billion, out of order, how can you efficiently sort it? Assume that you cannot store an array of a billion elements in memory.

# Answer:
This is most likely an approach to sort. Considering we can't do this in memory this will probably result in sharding.
Each shard can be sorted and then we can 'reduce' by merging.
Merge can either be done by iterating over files, pipes whatnot...
